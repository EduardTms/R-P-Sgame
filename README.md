## The Odion Project: Web Developement

----------------------------------------------------
This is my **first HTML/CSS/JS project.**

----------------------------------------------------
**What I learned:**

**First stage** (Game in browser console)
- Deepened knowledge of how functions work with each other.

**Second stage** (UI)
- Learned basic manipulations of elements styles through JavaScript code (setting attributes, adding/removing classes, changing inline styles and texts).
- Improved my understanding of JavaScript functions (organization, scopes, calling, invoking, breaking down into smaller ones.
- Deepened my understanding of media quarries and responsive websites.
- Deepened my CSS skills.


------------------------------------------------------
**Summary:**

- While working on this project I've deepened my knowledge in many areas, mostly CSS and vanilla JS. 
- As the project had to be done from scratch, I've improved my planning skills and breaking down problems into smaller ones.
- I have spent a lot of time debugging and figuring out why the code doesn't do what I want it to do. My understanding of error has improved and while doing research I acknowledged that my googling has improved and I could find the answers to my problems way easier than before.
- This might not be a perfect project but I am content with it and looking forward to improve more and more.
